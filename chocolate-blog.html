        <h2>How is it made?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Firstly, fermented and dried
          <a
            class="coca__beans"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean"

            >cocoa beans</a
          >

          will be refined to a roasted nib by winnowing and roasting. Then, they
          will be heated and will melt into chocolate liquor. Lastly,
          manufacturers blend chocolate liquor with sugar and milk to add
          flavour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The storage area must be isolated from the rest of the building to
          protect the sensitive beans from strong odors that might be absorbed.
          Good air circulation and a cool temperature are important, and the
          humidity regularly checked. You must be able to identify the beans
          according to their particular type and origin in order to control the
          flavor by blending beans for roasting.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2>Different kind of chocolates</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Different Types of Chocolate. There are four types of chocolate: dark,
          milk, white, and ruby. Chocolate comes from the seeds, or nibs, of the
          cacao tree. They are roasted and ground to produce a paste called
          chocolate liquor.

          <strong>Celebrations of Chocolate:</strong>

            <a
              class="coca__beans"

              >World Chocolate Day</a
            >
            falls on July 7, commemorating when chocolate was first introduced
            to Europe in 1550 (though some argue it might have arrived even
            earlier with Christopher Columbus). Other chocolate-themed days
            include National Milk Chocolate Day (July 28), International
            Chocolate Day (September 13), and the quirky National Bittersweet
            Chocolate With Almonds Day (November 7).

          <strong>White Chocolate Isn‚Äôt Chocolate:</strong>
          <p>
            <a class="coca__beans" href="" target="_blank">White chocolate</a>
            doesn‚Äôt qualify as true chocolate because it lacks cocoa solids or
            chocolate liquor. However, it does contain cocoa butter, a component
            of the cacao bean.
          </p>
          <strong>Cacao‚Äôs Ancient Roots:</strong>
          <p>
            The cacao bean hails from Mexico, Central America, and South
            America. Evidence suggests that humans in present-day Ecuador were
            enjoying cacao products around
            <a class="coca__beans" href="" target="_blank">5000 years ago</a>.
          </p>
          <strong>Hot Chocolate‚Äôs Origins:</strong>
          <p>
            Cacao was brewed in
            <a class="coca__beans" href="" target="_blank"
              >Mexican and Aztec cultures</a
            >, but their version was quite different from today‚Äôs hot chocolate.
            It was a bitter concoction used for ceremonies, not cozy sipping.
            Even Marie Antoinette loved her hot chocolate at the opulent Palace
            of Versailles.
          </p>
          <strong>Cacao as Currency:</strong>
          <p>
            The Aztecs valued cacao beans so highly that they used them as
            currency during their civilization‚Äôs peak. Imagine buying groceries
            with chocolate coins‚Äîsweet and practical.
          </p>
          <strong>Solid Chocolate‚Äôs Birth:</strong>
          <p>
            British confectioners at
            <a class="coca__beans" href="" target="_blank">J.S. Fry & Sons</a>
            invented ‚Äúeating chocolate‚Äù in 1847. It combined cocoa butter,
            sugar, and chocolate liquor, resulting in a grainy, solid form of
            the treat. This paved the way for the chocolate bars we know today.
          </p>
          <strong>Heart-Shaped Boxes of Chocolate:</strong>
          <p>
            You can thank Cadbury for inventing the heart-shaped box of
            chocolates. Perfect for last-minute Valentine‚Äôs Day gifts from gas
            stations! Because nothing says love like a heart full of cocoa
            goodness.
          </p>
          <strong>Napoleon‚Äôs Chocolate Fix:</strong>
          <p>
            Legend has it that Napoleon carried chocolate with him during
            military campaigns for an energy boost. Perhaps that‚Äôs how he
            conquered half of Europe! ‚ÄúGive me chocolate or give me
            defeat!‚Äù‚Äîprobably not what he said, but close enough.
          </p>
          <strong>Baker‚Äôs Chocolate Isn‚Äôt Just for Baking:</strong>
          <p>
            Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded their chocolate company,
            later known as
            <a class="coca__beans" href="" target="_blank"
              >Walter Baker Chocolate</a
            >, in the 18th century. The term ‚ÄúBaker‚Äôs chocolate‚Äù doesn‚Äôt just
            refer to cooking chocolate; it‚Äôs a nod to their legacy.
          </p>
          <strong>German Chocolate Cake Isn‚Äôt German:</strong>
          <p>
            Despite the name, German chocolate cake isn‚Äôt from Germany. It‚Äôs
            named after
            <a class="coca__beans" href="" target="_blank">Samuel German</a>, an
            American chocolatier. But hey, it‚Äôs still delicious, no matter its
            origin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, chocolate isn‚Äôt just a treat; it‚Äôs a rich tapestry of
            history, culture, and sheer delight. So go ahead, savor that piece
            of chocolate‚Äîit‚Äôs practically a time machine in a wrapper! üç´‚ù§Ô∏è
